These files control which data are used as constraints in the optimization
Flags are:
1: Optimize model using this data stream
2: Do not use this data stream in the optimization

The indicator at the end of the file is associated with the ‘rep’ variable in the main code. 
This allows running the optimization with different constraint configurations.

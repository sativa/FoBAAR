These are the files of the Fortran code for the FoBAAR model.

The main code is contained in
FoBAARbetaV5.2.f90

This code calls the following subroutines:
AssignLAI.f90: This calculates the fraction of total LAI that is sun light or shaded at each time step, and the amount of PAR received by both.

soilWaterContent.f90: This calculates the soil water content at each time step, using a simple bucket model.

PhotoSynth.f90: This calculates both photosynthesis and conductance using the coupled farquhar ball-berry equation. 

totalerrorV4bayes.f90: This calculates the cost function - the difference between the model predictions and the observations.

posteriorChiSqTest.f90: This calculates the chi squared test for model iterations post optimization, in order to explore the posterior distribution of parameters and the associated uncertainty in model predictions.
